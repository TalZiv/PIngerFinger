# PingerFinger is a "Virtual Finger" for hardware on remote data center.

It is an Arduino + Ethernet Shield sketch that does "Live" checks for a HTTP port
by creating HTTP client and if There is no response after a predetermined time it will RESET the server
By activating a relay which is connected to the RESET button.

The device has a web interface, serial and LED indicator output of current device status.

Simple yet effective device for my needs.
